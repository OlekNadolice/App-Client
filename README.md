# Reflections

- I wasn't stricte with naming convention when it comes to CSS, if i had a chance to do this project again I would probably go for BEM naming convention or go with STYLED COMPONENTS it would also help to make JSX less bulky.

- Images are stored on the server which is not good, but if I had a budget it would be definitely something like AWS.

- The hardest part of creating this app was design, it was always weak point of mine since im not desinger, I could probably copy design from other sites, but I wanted something mine.

- Overall I'm happy with this project, I learned a lot and I hope that my future projects will be even better.
